            The reason for choosing this field is the love and passaion I have for this field. having the opportunity to learn new skills and learn new things about the up and coming technology is one of my favourites about this field. Also being able to express my mind and be creative and being able to explore new things is another perk in this field. Being able to participate in many various competitions and hackthons is another great opportunity. I am glad to say that my team and i have successfully participated in Cutting Edge 23 where are project was about A safe school bus tracking system for Sri Lankan students.
